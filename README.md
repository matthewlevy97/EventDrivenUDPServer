# EventDrivenUDPServer
Simple UDP Server that uses signals to asynchronously handle datagram packets

This is a simple library to allow for async UDP handling.  This project was created to be incorporated into other projects that I am working on.

Currently the program just outputs whatever data is sent to it on port 8080/udp.
